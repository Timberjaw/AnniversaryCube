# AnniversaryCube
Futuro Cube code for puzzle room.

Uses the [PAWN](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm) programming language. There are two executables: SimonGroup and Roller.

**Roller** is configured on the Futuro cube to execute when the cube is physically unplugged. It initializes a small game where the player must roll the cube along a preset path. Successfully completing this task launches SimonGroup.

**SimonGroup** has two music/color-matching games linked by a shared color sequence menu. Inputting the appropriate color sequence launches the corresponding musical sub-game. Completing a sub-game gives a clue for the puzzle room.

**Simon1** and **Simon2** are the development versions of the two music sequences. They were combined into a single executable to form SimonGroup.
